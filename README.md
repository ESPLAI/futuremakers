# Sage FutureMakers

Welcome to the Sage Future Makers Github repository. Here you'll find all the resources and help you'll need for Sage FutureMakers. 

We've split the resources into three areas:

* instructions: PDFs showing how to do the workshop, as well as a manual for trainers
* python-notebooks: Files for Part B (Python notebooks, to run in the Jupyter Notebook)
* sample-web-app: Files for Part C (simple web app in Python with the Flask server, ready to deploy on Heroku)

Please note: there are two copies of futuremakers.py, one in python-notebooks, the other in sample-web-app. These are meant to be exactly the same. If you make a change to one, don't forget to copy it over to the other as well.

Please also note: the examples in this repository require two identical files, python-notebooks/passwords.py and sample-web-app/passwords.py, to work. These files contain Amazon Web Services passwords and MUST NOT be committed to this repository OR STORED ON ANY OTHER PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE WEB PAGE, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, or they will be stolen by automated scripts.
